      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Wilpattu National Park, located on the northwest coast of Sri Lanka,
        stands as one of the country's oldest and largest national parks,
        covering an expansive area of around 1,317 square kilometers. Renowned
        for its unique topography, Wilpattu is characterized by numerous natural
        lakes, or "villus," which add to its scenic beauty. The park holds
        historical significance as it was closed for several years during the
        civil conflict but reopened to the public in 2010, allowing conservation
        efforts to resume. Wilpattu is celebrated for its diverse ecosystem,
        housing a wide array of flora and fauna, including elephants, sloth
        bears, spotted deer, and a variety of bird species. It is particularly
        recognized as a prime habitat for the elusive Sri Lankan leopard. The
        park's untamed landscapes and cultural heritage make it a captivating
        destination for wildlife enthusiasts and those seeking a unique
        connection with Sri Lanka's natural wonders.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Wilpattu National Park, situated in the northwestern part of Sri Lanka,
        has a rich historical and ecological legacy. The park's name,
        "Wilpattu," is believed to originate from the term "Villu," referring to
        the numerous natural lakes that dot its landscape. With a history dating
        back to ancient times, Wilpattu has been a significant region, evident
        from the discovery of ancient ruins within its boundaries, showcasing
        human settlements that date back to the 5th century BC. Unfortunately,
        during the decades-long civil conflict in Sri Lanka, Wilpattu faced
        challenges, and access to the park was restricted for security reasons.
        After the conflict's conclusion, the park was reopened to the public in
        2010, marking a crucial moment for conservation efforts and the revival
        of its natural habitats. Today, Wilpattu National Park stands as a
        testament to both the resilience of nature and the collective commitment
        to preserving the rich biodiversity and historical treasures of this
        remarkable region.
