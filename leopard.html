          The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a subspecies of
          leopard native to the island of Sri Lanka in South Asia. Recognized
          for its distinct and vibrant coat, the Sri Lankan leopard is
          characterized by its golden-yellow fur marked with dark rosettes and
          spots. This elusive big cat is a top predator in its ecosystem and is
          known for its adaptability to various habitats, ranging from dense
          rainforests to grasslands and scrublands. The Sri Lankan leopard's
          slender and agile build enables it to navigate through diverse
          terrains with ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          While sharing some similarities with other leopard subspecies, the Sri
          Lankan leopard exhibits certain unique features, including a slightly
          smaller size compared to its African counterparts. Adult males
          typically weigh between 60 to 90 kilograms, while females are
          generally smaller. The species is known for its solitary nature, and
          individuals establish territories to avoid competition for resources.
          Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan leopard faces conservation challenges,
          primarily due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.
          Efforts are underway to protect and preserve these magnificent big
          cats, including initiatives to safeguard their natural habitats and
          promote coexistence between local communities and wildlife.

      </div>
      <p>
        The poaching of leopards represents a grave and persistent threat to the
        survival of these majestic big cats in the wild. Driven by illicit
        markets and traditional beliefs, poachers target leopards for their
        prized skins, bones, and other body parts. The illegal wildlife trade
        values leopard skins for their exquisite patterns, while various body
        parts are erroneously sought after for their supposed medicinal or
        mystical properties. Trophy hunting exacerbates the problem,
        contributing to the decline of leopard populations. In regions where
        human-wildlife conflict is prevalent, farmers may resort to retaliatory
        killings of leopards perceived as threats to livestock. The insidious
        impact of poaching not only decimates leopard numbers but also disrupts
        the delicate balance of ecosystems, affecting biodiversity at large.
        Conservation efforts are essential to combat poaching, encompassing
        rigorous law enforcement, community engagement, and education to
        dismantle the demand for leopard products and foster coexistence between
        humans and these crucial predators. The fight against leopard poaching
        is integral to preserving the rich biodiversity of the ecosystems they
        inhabit and securing a sustainable future for these iconic big cats.

        <p>
          Infrastructure development poses significant challenges to leopard
          populations, creating a range of problems that impact their habitats
          and overall well-being. Roads, highways, and urban expansion
          associated with infrastructure projects can fragment and encroach upon
          the natural landscapes where leopards roam. Increased human activity
          in these areas often leads to higher incidents of vehicle collisions
          with leopards, resulting in injuries or fatalities for these elusive
          big cats. Moreover, the expansion of infrastructure facilitates easier
          access for poachers seeking leopard skins and body parts, contributing
          to the illegal wildlife trade. The disruption caused by construction
          and human settlements can displace leopards from their territories,
          leading to conflicts with local communities as these apex predators
          search for food sources. Conservation efforts must address the
          intricate relationship between infrastructure development and leopard
          conservation, striving to implement measures that mitigate habitat
          fragmentation, enhance wildlife corridors, and minimize human-wildlife
          conflicts. Balancing the need for progress with the preservation of
          essential habitats is crucial to securing a sustainable future for
          leopard populations in the face of ongoing infrastructure development.
